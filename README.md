# Cowell Creative Project

Welcome to the **Cowell Creative Project**! This project is an interactive, text-based adventure game that takes the player through significant decades of American history, exploring the life of Samuel, a young Black man navigating the ever-changing cultural, social, and economic landscapes of the United States from the 1920s to the 2020s.

## Description

The project follows Samuel as he makes decisions that impact his journey through each decade. The player is presented with various scenarios and must choose how Samuel should respond. Each choice comes with consequences, ranging from financial gains and losses to life-altering outcomes.

Samuel's adventure begins in the 1920s and progresses chronologically through each decade, allowing the player to explore historical challenges and opportunities faced by African Americans throughout different periods. The game incorporates humor, historical context, and elements of risk, making it both an educational and engaging experience.

### Key Features
- **Interactive Gameplay**: Players make choices that determine the fate of Samuel in each decade, simulating the uncertainties and opportunities of life.
- **Historical Context**: Each decade is crafted to reflect important historical moments and cultural shifts, providing an educational yet fun experience.
- **Consequential Decisions**: Choices matter! Some decisions lead to financial success, while others can lead to Samuel's untimely death.
- **Sound Effects**: Audio cues such as the "womp womp" sound effect indicate negative outcomes, adding a layer of immersion.

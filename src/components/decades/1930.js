        1930s: Surviving the Great Depression
      </h2>
      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
        The 1930s brought the Great Depression, a time of widespread economic
        hardship and unemployment. Samuel, now a young adult, faces tough
        decisions to support himself and his community. With limited
        opportunities, he must navigate between survival, solidarity, and
        self-preservation. Will he find a way to thrive or fall victim to the
        struggles of the era?

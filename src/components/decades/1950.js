        1950s: Battling Segregation and Embracing Opportunities
      </h2>
      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
        The 1950s were marked by the fight for civil rights, widespread
        segregation, and limited opportunities for Black Americans. Samuel, now
        a father, strives to provide for his family and protect them from the
        harsh realities of systemic racism. As the Civil Rights Movement begins
        to gain momentum, Samuel faces critical decisions that could shape his
        and his familyâ€™s future. Will he find a way to prosper or fall victim to
        the obstacles of the era?
